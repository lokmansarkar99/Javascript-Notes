// JSON Syntax & Structure
// JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to store and exchange data.

// JSON Structure:
// Data is represented as key-value pairs.
// Keys are always strings (enclosed in double quotes).
// Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
